                <h2>Get ready</h2>
                <p>Wear gardening gloves (use a litter picker if you have one). This will <strong>protect your
                        hands</strong> from anything mucky or sharp.</p>
                <p>Bring a bag so you can carry litter with you, or use the public bins if there are
                    any nearby.</p>
                <p><span class="heart">❤ </span>On our group litter picks we'll have a designated spot to leave the bags for a special rubbish
                    collection.</p>
                <p><strong>Dress for the weather</strong>, it could be muddy or slippery, or hot, so wear sunscreen and
                    have some water with you.</p>
                <h2>Keep safe!</h2>
                <p>Please don't carry more than you can manage - just picking up a little will help!</p>
                <p>Stay away from broken glass, and don't pick up nappies or fox poo! Take extra care when picking up anything sharp. <strong>If you're not sure what it
                    is, don't pick it up</strong>.</p>
                <p>Report anything you think might be dangerous, to councillor Danny or an ELP member, or tell an adult.
                <p><strong>Wash your hands!</strong> Always wash your hands properly after picking litter.</p>

                <p><quote>Any litter removed from a natural ecosystem helps wildlife and creates a better space for humans
                    too! Counteract litterbugs by being a litter picker. You don't have to be on an organised litter
                    pick to help, just pick up any rogue litter when you see it and pop it in the bin! Or how about
                    going for a
                    walk and picking up pieces as you go?</quote><cite>The Wildlife Trusts</cite></p>
