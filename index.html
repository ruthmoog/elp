            <h2>Litter picking with #30DaysWild!</h2>
            <p><strong>The Wildlife Trusts</strong> have asked us to do one wild thing a day throughout the month of
                June, for their annual <a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/30dayswild">30 Days Wild</a> challenge.
            </p>
            <p>ELP would like to encourage everyone in our community to take part by joining one of our group
                litterpicks, or picking up litter in your area.</p>

                            <p>This walk will give you an experience of being a Citizen Scientist with the Bumblebee
                                Conservation Trust's BeeWalk project. Join Ruth Baker, a BeeWalk volunteer on their
                                transect in the Castle Hill area, to identify and collect data on our local bumblebees.
                            </p>
                            <p>Please meet just off of Castle Hill Drive at the bottom of the hill (which leads to the
                                Observatory). The walk is about 1 hr at a constant pace and will leave promptly at 2pm.
                                The route is mainly on paved or gravel pathways, there are some slopes and steps.</p>
                        </details>
                        <p>This walk is <strong>weather dependent</strong>, and may be cancelled in the event of very

                <h2>Get ready</h2>
                <p>Wear gardening gloves (use a litter picker if you have one). This will <strong>protect your
                        hands</strong> from anything mucky or sharp.</p>
                <p>Bring a bag so you can carry litter with you, or use the public bins if there are
                    any nearby.</p>
                <p><span class="heart">❤ </span>On our group litter picks we'll have a designated spot to leave the bags
                    for a special rubbish
                    collection.</p>
                <p><strong>Dress for the weather</strong>, it could be muddy or slippery, or hot, so wear sunscreen and
                    have some water with you.</p>
                <h2>Keep safe!</h2>
                <p>Please don't carry more than you can manage - just picking up a little will help!</p>
                <p>Stay away from broken glass, and don't pick up nappies or fox poo! Take extra care when picking up
                    anything sharp. <strong>If you're not sure what it
                        is, don't pick it up</strong>.</p>
                <p>Report anything you think might be dangerous, to councillor Danny or an ELP member, or tell an adult.
                <p><strong>Wash your hands!</strong> Always wash your hands properly after picking litter.</p>

                        pick to help, just pick up any rogue litter when you see it and pop it in the bin!</p>
